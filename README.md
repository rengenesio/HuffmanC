HuffmanC
========

Huffman algorithm based Encoder/Decoder written in C (normal, optimized, multithreaded and gpu (CUDA) versions)


NORMAL VERSION
---------------
Simple sequential Huffman algorithm Encoder/Decoder implementation.
Edit the 'Makefile' with the desired compilator optimization option (-O0, -O1, -O2 or -O3) and compile: make normal

OPTIMIZED VERSION
---------------
Normal version with code optimizations for fastest execution.
Edit the 'Makefile' with the desired compilator optimization option (-O0, -O1, -O2 or -O3) and compile: make optimized

MULTITHREADED VERSION
---------------
Multithreaded Huffman algorithm Encoder/Decoder implementation.
Edit the 'Makefile' with the desired compilator optimization option (-O0, -O1, -O2 or -O3) and compile: make optimized
